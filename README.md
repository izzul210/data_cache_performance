# data_cache_performance

Exploring the factors that can effect the performance of a program with heavily focus on L1 data cache within the Cortex-A9 of DE1-SoC


Part 1: Measuring 3 performance counters (clock cycles, load instructions and L1 data chache misses) within Cortex-A9

Part 2: Writing ARM assemble code that does matrix multiplication and computed the average CPI (cycels per instruction)
